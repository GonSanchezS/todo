# README

Rise Up is just another MVC-todo application, built to play with Javascript. Rise Up is hosted on Heroku, and can be accessed by clicking [here](http://todo-gonsanchezs.heroku.com/). 

A few things to consider:
* Rise Up runs on Ruby 2.0.0, and Rails 4.0.4
* Database is postgresql

### Installation

Setting up Rise Up locally is super easy :rocket:

1 - Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/GonSanchezS/todo.git```

2 - Install it: 
```bundle install```

3 - Create the database:
```rake db:create```

4 - Run the migration:
```rake db:migrate```


Depending on your environment and setup configuration you  may need to change ```config/database.yml```.
